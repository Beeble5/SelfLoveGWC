					<p> A study performed by David Sloan Wilson, an evolutionary biologist, showed that there are two different temperaments shown among fish. Those temperaments are known as "sitters" and "rovers". "Rovers" are much more likely than "sitters" to rush into a new situation and investigate it, while "sitters" are more likely to watch and observe first. Wilson put fish traps in a pond filled with Pumkinseed Sunfish and observed their behavior. The "rovers" went up to the traps and got caught. The "sitters" stayed back and watched, avoiding the traps. Had the traps been deadly, the "sitter" fish would have been the only survivors. </p>

			<br>Different.

			<br>I don't want to fit your mold.
			<br>Confident, loud, social.
			<br>That's not me.
			<br>
			<br>I want to be myself.
			<br>Quiet, imaginative, independent.
			<br>I don't want to throw that away.
			<br>
			<br>I am a listener,

			<br>I am a thinker,
			<br>not a speaker.
			<br>I am reader,
			<br>not a performer.

			<br>I don't want to fit your mold.
			<br>You say I won't be successful,
			<br>but I will.
			<br>You say I won't be able to communicate,
			<br>but I will.
			<br>Because isn't that what I'm doing right now,
			<br>with writing?
			<br>I do not, will not, cannot
